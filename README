# Dataset of neurons and intracranial EEG from human amygdala during aversive dynamic visual stimulation

## Summary
We present an electrophysiological dataset collected from the amygdalae of nine subjects attending a visual dynamic stimulation of emotional aversive content. The subjects were patients affected by epilepsy who underwent preoperative invasive monitoring in the mesial temporal lobe. Subjects were presented with dynamic visual sequences of fearful faces (aversive condition), interleaved with sequences of neutral landscapes (neutral condition).

We provide the recordings of intracranial EEG (iEEG) and metadata related to the task, subjects, sessions and electrodes in the BIDS standard.

We also provide a more extended version of the dataset that includes neuronal spike times and waveforms in the NIX standard under the folder "bidsignore/data_NIX". This extended dataset is also available in G-Node at https://gin.g-node.org/USZ_NCH/Human_Amygdala_MUA_sEEG_FearVideo/.

This dataset allows the investigation of amygdalar response to dynamic aversive stimuli at multiple spatial scales, from the macroscopic EEG to the neuronal firing in the human brain.

## Repository structure

### Main directory (hfo/)
Contains metadata files in the BIDS standard about the participants and the study. Folders are wxplained below.

### Subfolders
* hfo/sub-**/
Contains folders for each subject, named sub-<subject number> and session information.
* hfo/sub-**/ses-01/eeg
Contains the raw eeg data in .edf format for each subject. The duration is typically 3 hours, that was recorded in the beginning of the sleep. Details about the channels are given in the corresponding .tsv file. 
* hfo/derivatives
Besides containingsubfolders for the raw data, there are two .json files. The events_description.json explains the meaning of the columns of the event description tsv files (in the subfolders).
The interval_description.json explains the meaning of the columns of the interval description tsv files (in the subfolders).

* hfo/derivatives/sub-**/ses-01/eeg/
Contains processed data for each subject. Based on the sleep annotations, first we identified the sleep stages. Then we cut 5 minutes data intervals from the N3 sleep stages. We applied bipolar referencing by considering all nearest neighbour chanels, thus resulting in 52 bipolar channels. Each run corresponds to one 5 minute data interval. The DataIntervals.tsv file provides information about how the various runs are related to the raw data by providing the start and end indeces. Besides the .edf and channel descriptor .tsv files there is an other .tsv file containing the detected candidate event details. Eg. sub-26_ses-01_task-hfo_run-01_events.tsv contains for subject 26 for the first processed data interval the event markings as indeces with additional features of this event described in the abovementioned events_description.json file.
